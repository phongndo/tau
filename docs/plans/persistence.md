# Persistence Plan

**Status**: ✅ Finished — all phases complete  
**Last updated**: 2026-05-17

The target architecture described below is fully implemented. `taud` is a single
static Zig binary that owns PTY lifecycle, VT parsing, event logs, current-screen
snapshots, SQLite metadata, agent adapter spawning, retention, and privacy controls.
The Electron UI is a thin client that attaches/detaches from daemon sessions.
No further phases are planned.

## Overview

Tau's persistence goal is **process and agent continuity**, not replaying old shell scrollback. Tau
is a terminal for orchestrating AI agents through CLIs such as `pi`, `codex`, `claude`, and similar
tools. Persistence therefore needs to preserve three things:

1. **Live process continuity** — if an AI CLI is still running, Tau should reattach to the same PTY
   and conversation after the UI restarts.
2. **Native command/session resume** — if the live process is gone, Tau should restart configured
   terminal apps or relaunch supported AI CLIs via their native resume/session mechanisms.
3. **Useful metadata, not fake history** — layout, cwd, titles, last command/agent identity, and
   bounded diagnostic excerpts can be kept, but Tau should not replay old `zsh`/shell scrollback into
   a new live terminal.

The architecture is a hybrid:

- **`taud` daemon** (Zig) owns PTYs, AI CLI subprocesses, terminal event logs, metadata, and agent
  adapters. The Electron UI is a client that attaches/detaches.
- **Optional current-screen snapshots** improve live reattach first paint when a supported backend can
  serialize the visible screen, but are not a cold shell-history restore mechanism.
- **Framed PTY event logs** provide diagnostics, bounded excerpts, and agent/session-id extraction;
  they are not replayed into newly spawned shells.
- **Agent adapters/hooks** capture native AI CLI session IDs and resume commands.
- **SQLite** stores session metadata, optional current-screen metadata, agent session metadata, and
  searchable excerpts.
- **JSON files** remain the source of truth for human-editable settings and UI layout.

This replaces the current Zustand `persist` + browser `localStorage` model.

---

## Current Implementation Status

The full daemon/agent-resume architecture below is the target design. The current codebase now has an
Electron-side persistence slice that reduces data loss and removes renderer-only layout storage, plus
an initial Zig daemon skeleton/tooling setup while the larger `taud` runtime work is pending.

### Implemented now

- **File-backed UI layout**: pane/workspace/tab layout is persisted to `~/.tau/pane-layouts.json`
  through Electron main IPC instead of Zustand `persist` + browser `localStorage`.
- **One-time localStorage migration**: existing `localStorage['tao-workspaces']` or
  `localStorage['tau-workspaces']` data is read once
  and then removed after a successful migration path is available.
- **File-backed settings service**: `~/.tau/settings.json` read/write IPC exists with default
  persistence settings.
- **Stable pane/session identifiers**: panes now carry `terminalId` and `lastSessionId` so layout
  identity is separate from terminal session identity.
- **Stable terminal IDs reach `taud`**: the renderer/preload/MessagePort bridge now forwards
  `terminalId` separately from `sessionId`, allowing daemon metadata and cold-restart lookup to key
  panes by their stable terminal identity instead of only the current PTY session id.
- **Framed PTY event log prototype**: PTY output, resize, and exit frames are appended under
  `~/.tau/sessions/<session-id>/events.tauev` with sequence numbers and CRC checks.
- **Hardened event-log parsing**: readers validate the file header, frame CRCs, monotonic sequence
  numbers, partial tails, and bounded truncation. Raw cold replay into a newly spawned shell is now
  removed from the app path because replaying arbitrary PTY tails creates fake/stale terminal state.
- **No cold shell scrollback restore**: if a pane's process is gone, Tau starts a fresh shell or will
  run the captured CLI/agent resume command. Old `zsh` scrollback is not shown as a restored terminal.
- **Historical file-store retention maintenance (superseded)**: the old utility PTY service
  retention/clear-history path has been replaced by daemon-owned retention and clear-history RPCs.
- **Explicit transitional session APIs**: preload now exposes `createSession`, `attachSession`,
  `detachSession`, `writeSessionInput`, `resizeSession`, `killSession`, and `onSessionOutput`
  wrappers over the daemon-backed PTY bridge.
- **Event-log regression tests**: the daemon framed-log implementation has Zig tests for CRC
  rejection, partial tails, bounded diagnostics/excerpts, and cleanup behavior.
- **First-paint/render stability fixes**: the Electron window is shown only after the active pane is
  ready; inactive terminals no longer signal app readiness; automatic DevTools opening is disabled;
  terminal surfaces stay hidden through initial fit/resize settle to avoid exposing intermediate
  Ghostty renders.
- **Renderer/window reload survival**: closing a BrowserWindow no longer kills PTY ownership because
  `taud` owns sessions outside the renderer and new renderer ports reconnect through the daemon bridge.
- **Electron install repair**: `scripts/electron-install.ts` repairs incomplete Electron binary
  installs before `dev` / `start`.
- **Initial Zig daemon skeleton**: `apps/daemon` now exists as a Bun workspace package with
  `build.zig`, `src/main.zig`, module boundaries for daemon/session/RPC/PTY/event-log/snapshot/DB/
  adapter/cleanup/VT work, a real POSIX PTY boundary, SQLite migration strings, and Zig unit tests
  for the scaffolded pieces. The daemon is buildable but not yet used by the Electron app.
- **Daemon control RPC/session registry prototype**: `taud` now binds `~/.tau/run/taud.sock`, accepts
  newline-delimited JSON control requests, handles create/attach/resize/detach/kill against an
  in-memory session registry, and returns typed JSON responses. Requests now accept the documented
  `type`/camelCase fields while preserving the scaffold's older `method`/snake_case shape.
- **Daemon binary stream frame codec**: `apps/daemon/src/rpc.zig` now has a tested binary frame
  encoder/parser for output, input, resize, snapshot, exit, and agent frames, including session IDs,
  sequence numbers, payload lengths, CRC checks, partial-tail handling, and packed resize/exit
  payload helpers. `@tau/shared/taud-protocol` exports matching stream constants for the future
  Electron client. The stream session-id field is now large enough for Tau's current prefixed UUID
  session IDs.
- **Daemon POSIX PTY driver**: `apps/daemon/src/pty.zig` now uses `forkpty`/`execvp`, applies
  initial and subsequent window sizes, supports PTY input writes, output reads, termination, and
  non-blocking child-exit polling.
- **Daemon socket-level attach stream**: `taud` now keeps accepting control clients while per-attach
  worker threads bridge binary INPUT/RESIZE frames from clients to the PTY and OUTPUT/EXIT frames
  back to clients. Attach streams now attach to live output only; old event logs are not replayed as
  terminal scrollback.
- **Daemon-owned background PTY readers**: each spawned PTY now has a daemon-owned reader thread that
  continues draining output, appending event logs, and broadcasting to attached clients even while no
  renderer is attached. A bounded in-memory pending-output buffer covers create-before-attach and
  short live reattach gaps without replaying cold event-log scrollback.
- **Daemon-owned event-log writes**: sessions created with an argv now get `events.tauev` files under
  `~/.tau/sessions/<session-id>/`, and daemon PTY output, resize, and exit frames are appended from
  the Zig side for diagnostics/metadata extraction, not terminal replay.
- **Zig-native libghostty-vt integration**: `apps/daemon/src/vt.zig` now isolates the daemon VT
  parser boundary, session objects own a Zig-native upstream `ghostty-vt` instance, and daemon PTY
  output/resize events are fed into that state before live stream broadcast. The daemon toolchain is
  pinned to Zig 0.15.x to match upstream libghostty-vt; the hand-rolled fallback and system C ABI
  wrapper have been retired.
- **Current-screen snapshot daemon support**: the VT wrapper now exposes explicit current-screen
  serialize/deserialize capability, the Ghostty-native backend round-trips a versioned visible-screen
  VT restore payload, `snapshot.zig` writes/reads a CRC-checked `current-screen.state` envelope, and
  `taud` checkpoints live current-screen state on detach while also sending snapshot stream frames on
  attach.
- **Current-screen snapshot consumption**: the Electron `taud` bridge forwards daemon snapshot stream
  frames through preload as explicit live-session snapshot events; the renderer decodes the shared
  snapshot envelope, applies supported Ghostty-native current-screen frames before first paint,
  suppresses duplicate pending output through the snapshot sequence, and ignores archived/cold/
  unsupported snapshots instead of treating them as shell-history restore.
- **Current-screen snapshot compatibility tests**: TypeScript stream tests cover snapshot envelope CRC
  validation, native/fallback payload decoding/rendering, unsupported backend gating, and binary
  stream carriage of snapshot frames.
- **Daemon-owned retention and clear-history controls**: `taud` now accepts control RPCs for
  `clear-history` and `cleanup`. Live/in-memory sessions keep their PTYs while their event logs and
  excerpts are reset, inactive session directories can be deleted by explicit clear-history, and
  retention cleanup honors configured age/size limits while preserving sessions known to the daemon
  or Electron bridge.
- **Initial daemon SQLite layer via `zig-sqlite`**: `taud` now opens `~/.tau/tau.db`, applies ordered
  migrations for `terminal_sessions`, `agent_sessions`, and FTS search, and mirrors terminal session
  create/attach/resize/detach/exit metadata outside the PTY-output hot path. The earlier hand-rolled
  `sqlite3` C ABI declarations were replaced with the `vrischmann/zig-sqlite` package in
  `apps/daemon/build.zig.zon` with FTS5 enabled.
- **SQLite restart/search metadata expansion**: `taud` can now look up persisted terminal-session
  rows by session/terminal id, prune metadata for deleted diagnostic logs, clear stale FTS rows when
  history is reset, store bounded search excerpts in `terminal_search`, and query indexed excerpts.
- **Cold command relaunch from metadata**: when an attach targets a session that is not in the
  in-memory daemon registry, `taud` reads the saved `argv_json`/cwd/size metadata and starts a new
  PTY with that command instead of replaying old scrollback. If the restart command cannot be run,
  Electron still falls back to creating a fresh shell.
- **Agent adapter spawning and built-in scripts**: `taud` now looks for adapter scripts in
  `TAUD_ADAPTER_DIR` or `~/.tau/adapters`, spawns `pi.ts`, `codex.ts`, and `claude.ts` with the
  documented NDJSON-style command contract, captures native session ids from adapter output or argv
  flags, stores `agent_sessions` rows, and prefers stored adapter resume argv when cold-starting a
  previously agent-driven terminal. The desktop build copies bundled adapters next to the bundled
  daemon and passes the adapter directory to `taud`.
- **Electron main `taud` bridge**: the desktop main process now has a `TaudClient` that launches or
  connects to `taud`, translates the existing MessagePort session protocol to daemon JSON control
  RPC plus binary stream frames, creates shell sessions through the daemon, streams output/resize/exit
  frames back to the renderer, and forwards clear-history/retention maintenance to the daemon.
- **Renderer daemon attach path**: terminal panes now use the explicit session APIs for attach,
  input, resize, kill, output, exit, and errors. Attach results carry whether Tau reattached live,
  started fresh, relaunched a saved command, or resumed an agent; command/agent resume results are
  surfaced in the terminal UI without replaying old scrollback.
- **Daemon-only desktop PTY path**: the Electron main process no longer falls back to the legacy
  utility-process `pty-service` path. If `taud` cannot be launched or reached, the renderer receives
  an explicit daemon-unavailable error instead of silently switching persistence backends.
- **Production daemon bundling**: desktop production builds now copy the built `taud` binary into
  the Electron output (`out/bin/taud`), and the desktop client resolves that bundled binary before
  falling back to source-tree development paths or `TAUD_PATH`.
- **Daemon lifecycle supervision**: the Electron `TaudClient` now health-checks `taud`, restarts it
  after process exit/crash, and retries startup instead of treating the daemon as a one-shot child.
- **Slow-client backpressure policy**: daemon attach sockets are switched to non-blocking mode for
  stream writes; subscribers that cannot keep up are explicitly dropped while PTY draining, event-log
  append, VT state, and other subscribers continue.
- **Legacy Electron event-log scaffold removed**: the old desktop-side `session-persistence` event-log
  writer/replay helper and `node-pty` install repair hook are gone; event logs are daemon-owned
  diagnostics only and are not a desktop fallback backend.
- **Zig tooling and CI support**: Nix now provides Zig 0.15.x, matching ZLS, and `nixpkgs-fmt`; root
  Bun `zig:*` scripts wrap build/test/lint/format/LSP checks; CI installs Zig 0.15.2, pins macOS jobs
  to macOS 15 for that toolchain, runs `bun run check`, verifies the Nix dev-shell/ZLS path, and builds
  `taud` before desktop production builds.
- **Daemon-side persistence privacy controls**: desktop settings now sync `persistence.enabled` and
  `persistInput` into `taud`. Disabling persistence keeps live PTY/process continuity in memory but
  stops daemon event-log, excerpt, snapshot, SQLite metadata, search, and agent-resume writes before
  terminal output is persisted. Optional input-frame logging remains off by default and is gated by
  `persistInput`.
- **Phase 12 stress/fault coverage**: persistence tests now cover oversized daemon control payloads,
  attach-stream tails, failed/slow subscriber dropping, bounded large pending-output frames, bursty
  stream parsing, oversized stream headers, and corrupt agent-resume metadata falling back to saved
  command metadata instead of failing cold resume.

### Important limitations of the current slice

- There is now an **Electron-integrated `taud` path**, and it is the only desktop PTY backend. The
  main process launches/connects to a bundled daemon in production builds and supervises daemon
  health, but OS-level launch-agent/service integration is still future work.
- Live reattach in the shipping Electron path now depends on the daemon staying alive. The daemon path
  keeps PTYs outside the renderer/window and drains detached PTY output in daemon-owned reader
  threads. Electron now supervises/restarts `taud`, but a daemon crash still downgrades existing
  terminals to command/agent resume because arbitrary Unix process memory cannot be resurrected.
- Native current-screen snapshots are **visible-screen restore payloads**, not cold scrollback. The
  daemon serializes the active libghostty-vt screen to VT restore bytes and the renderer applies them
  only for live first paint; archived/cold snapshots are still ignored rather than replayed as shell
  history.
- There is **no cold terminal scrollback restore by design**. Dead sessions start fresh or resume via
  native CLI/agent mechanisms; event-log excerpts are for diagnostics/search/adapter detection.
- There is an **expanded SQLite metadata layer**. `terminal_sessions`, basic `agent_sessions`, and
  FTS excerpt indexing now exist for internal diagnostics. By design, there is no user-facing search
  UI — persistence is invisible; the user sees their terminals, not session metadata.
- There is an **external adapter-script runtime** with built-in `pi`/`codex`/`claude` scripts and a
  built-in argv heuristic fallback. Adapter execution is intentionally small and optional; richer
  provider-specific transcript discovery and third-party adapter hardening are still future work.
- Persistence can now be disabled for the daemon path, but existing on-disk history is intentionally
  left in place until the user runs Clear History or retention cleanup removes it.

### Next recommended work

1. **Harden and expand agent adapters** so third-party providers can add richer discovery/resume
   logic, adapter timeouts, and transcript parsing without recompiling `taud`.
2. **Harden/package native VT snapshots** by fuzzing the Ghostty-native snapshot decoder, bounding
   renderer apply failures, and documenting compatibility for older fallback snapshot payloads.
3. **Harden privacy controls** with more granular policies for metadata-only, excerpts-only, and
   provider-specific agent transcript discovery.

## Restore Guarantees

Tau should make explicit, honest guarantees:

| Level                       | Scenario                                                                 | Restore behavior                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Live reattach**        | `taud` and the PTY process are still alive                               | Reattach to the same PTY and same AI CLI process. This is true full restore.                                |
| **2. Agent/command resume** | PTY/process died, but Tau captured a supported resume command/session ID | Spawn the adapter-specific resume command or saved terminal preset and attach to the new PTY.               |
| **3. Fresh shell fallback** | No live process and no known resume path                                 | Restore layout/cwd and start a fresh shell. Do not replay old shell scrollback as if it were live terminal. |

Tau cannot generally resurrect arbitrary dead Unix process memory. Full live-process restore requires
keeping the process alive in `taud`.

## Goals

| Goal                         | Why                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Live AI CLI reattach**     | Closing/restarting Tau UI must not kill long-running AI agent chats.                                      |
| **Command/app relaunch**     | If no live process exists, restart the saved command/preset instead of showing stale shell history.       |
| **Crash resilience**         | Event logs and metadata support diagnostics and agent/session-id extraction after failures.               |
| **Agent-aware cold resume**  | Capture native AI session IDs and relaunch supported agents after daemon/process death.                   |
| **Pane/session correctness** | Sessions attach to logical terminal/pane IDs, not just workspaces.                                        |
| **Efficient hot path**       | PTY output is bytes → log append → libghostty-vt parser → stream; no SQLite writes per chunk.             |
| **Searchable excerpts**      | Store bounded plaintext excerpts/FTS rows for search/debug without treating them as terminal restore.     |
| **Effect-TS services**       | DB/file/daemon services use Effect layers and typed errors across desktop/taud bridge.                    |
| **Security/privacy**         | Terminal logs can contain secrets; use restrictive permissions, retention controls, and clear-history UX. |

---

## Non-Goals / Boundaries

- Tau does **not** become the source of truth for proprietary agent memory. Agent CLIs own their own
  chat/session storage.
- Tau does **not** promise exact restoration of a dead process unless that process stayed alive in
  `taud`.
- Tau does **not** store shell input history as a separate feature. Shells still own shell history.
- Tau does not put PTY output chunks on the SQLite hot path.

## Why Zig for `taud`

| Factor                 | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **libghostty-vt link** | `libghostty-vt` is Ghostty's embeddable VT core for parsing terminal sequences and maintaining terminal state. `taud` links it directly as a Zig library — no WASM, no JS ABI boundary. |
| **Self-contained**     | Single static binary. No Node runtime, no npm dependencies, no version conflicts with the Electron app.                                                                                 |
| **Performance**        | PTY hot path is memory-safe zero-copy: PTY read → event log append/metadata extraction → socket broadcast. All in one process, no GC pauses.                                            |
| **Optional VT state**  | A VT layer can later provide current-screen state for live reattach polish, but not cold scrollback replay.                                                                             |

Trade-off acknowledged:

- Agent adapter logic (pi/codex/claude detection, resume commands, environment setup) is more
  verbose in Zig than TypeScript. Solution: agent adapters live as **small separate scripts**
  (TypeScript/Node or shell) that taud spawns on demand. The core daemon stays Zig.

---

## Why `libghostty-vt`, not full `libghostty`

`taud` is headless. It needs Ghostty's virtual-terminal core, not a renderer or platform frontend.

If linked later, use `libghostty-vt` for:

- VT escape sequence parsing
- current screen, cursor, styles, colors, and modes
- resize/reflow
- render-state data for clients
- plain-text/formatter extraction for search
- input/key/mouse encoding where useful

Do **not** put Ghostty's GUI/platform layer in `taud`:

- no Metal/OpenGL rendering
- no font discovery/layout
- no platform windows/tabs/splits
- no renderer event loop

Tau owns daemon/session/process concerns around the VT core: PTY lifecycle, live reattach, event
logs, SQLite metadata, retention, and AI-agent resume orchestration.

Note: `libghostty-vt` is still API-in-flux upstream. Tau should wrap it behind `apps/daemon/src/vt.zig`
so upstream API churn is isolated to one file.

Current implementation note: Tau's wrapper is now present and fed by the daemon hot path. The daemon
toolchain is pinned to Zig 0.15.x to match upstream libghostty-vt, `build.zig.zon` depends on the
Ghostty package, and `vt_ghostty_native.zig` imports the upstream `ghostty-vt` Zig module. The old
hand-rolled fallback and system `libghostty-vt` C ABI wrapper have been retired.

## Zig-native libghostty-vt Integration

`libghostty-vt` is Ghostty's embeddable virtual-terminal core. It can handle VT parsing, current
screen state, resize/reflow, modes, styles, render state, input encoding, and formatting. Tau now
imports Ghostty's upstream `ghostty-vt` Zig module directly from `build.zig.zon` and wraps it behind
`apps/daemon/src/vt.zig` / `vt_ghostty_native.zig` so upstream API churn remains isolated. Tau still
must not use VT state to replay old shell scrollback after a process is gone.

```zig
// apps/daemon/src/vt_ghostty_native.zig
const ghostty_vt = @import("ghostty-vt");

pub const Terminal = struct {
    handle: *ghostty_vt.Terminal,
    stream: ghostty_vt.ReadonlyStream,

    pub fn init(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, cols: u16, rows: u16) !Terminal {
        // Allocate the upstream terminal on the heap so the stream's handler
        // pointer remains stable even if Tau session structs move in memory.
    }

    pub fn write(self: *Terminal, bytes: []const u8) !void {
        try self.stream.nextSlice(bytes);
    }

    pub fn serializeCurrentScreenAlloc(self: *const Terminal, allocator: std.mem.Allocator) ![]u8 {
        // Emit a versioned Tau wrapper around Ghostty's VT formatter output.
        // This is a live visible-screen payload, not a cold scrollback format.
    }
};
```

The daemon still owns PTY lifecycle, session management, persistence, and agent orchestration. Native
current-screen snapshots are stable, versioned, endian-defined, pointer-free, CRC-checked visible-
screen restore payloads. Historical scrollback remains outside the live-reattach contract.

---

## SQLite

`taud` uses the `vrischmann/zig-sqlite` package declared via `build.zig.zon`, replacing the
earlier hand-rolled `extern "c" fn` C ABI calls with a type-safe Zig binding.
Schema uses STRICT tables, WAL, foreign keys.

### Migration 001 — `terminal_sessions`

```sql
CREATE TABLE terminal_sessions (
    id                 TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    terminal_id        TEXT NOT NULL,
    workspace_id       TEXT,

CREATE TRIGGER update_terminal_sessions_updated_at
    AFTER UPDATE ON terminal_sessions
    BEGIN
        UPDATE terminal_sessions SET updated_at = datetime('now') WHERE id = NEW.id;
    END;
```

### Migration 002 — `agent_sessions`

```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_sessions (
    id                  TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    terminal_session_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES terminal_sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

) STRICT;

CREATE INDEX idx_agent_sessions_terminal ON agent_sessions(terminal_session_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_agent_sessions_provider_native ON agent_sessions(provider, native_session_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_agent_sessions_status ON agent_sessions(status);

CREATE TRIGGER update_agent_sessions_updated_at
    AFTER UPDATE ON agent_sessions
    BEGIN
        UPDATE agent_sessions SET updated_at = datetime('now') WHERE id = NEW.id;
    END;
```

### Migration 003 — search index

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE terminal_search USING fts5(
    terminal_session_id UNINDEXED,
    workspace_id UNINDEXED,
    title,
    excerpt,
    tokenize = 'unicode61'
);
```

## Event Log Format

Framed binary event log. Each session has one append-only file.

```
File header:
  magic       "TAUEV\0\1"    (8 bytes)
  session_id  uuid            (36 bytes)
  created_at  unix_ms         (u64, 8 bytes)

Repeated frames:
  magic       u32             (0x54414546 = "TAEF")
  version     u16             (1)
  kind        u16             (enum: 1=OUTPUT, 2=INPUT, 3=RESIZE, 4=TITLE, 5=CWD, 6=AGENT_EVENT, 7=SNAPSHOT_MARK, 8=EXIT)
  seq         u64             (monotonic per session)
  monotonic_ms  u64
  length      u32
  crc32       u32
  payload     u8[length]
```

Frame kinds:

| Kind            | Payload                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OUTPUT`        | raw PTY bytes (use encoding:null)                        |
| `INPUT`         | optional user input bytes (default off, privacy setting) |
| `RESIZE`        | `{ cols: u16, rows: u16 }`                               |
| `TITLE`         | UTF-8 title string                                       |
| `CWD`           | UTF-8 cwd string                                         |
| `AGENT_EVENT`   | adapter-specific JSON                                    |
| `SNAPSHOT_MARK` | `{ snapshot_seq: u64, snapshot_path: str }`              |
| `EXIT`          | `{ exit_code: i32, signal: i32 }`                        |

Important rules:

- `seq` is monotonically increasing per terminal session.
- Event logs are not replayed into newly spawned shells. They are retained for diagnostics, bounded
  excerpts, and adapter/session-id extraction.
- SQLite stores metadata, not each frame. The frames live on disk.

---

## Daemon Protocol — control RPC + binary stream

Taud exposes local Unix domain sockets under `~/.tau/run/`. Use JSON/NDJSON only for low-volume
control messages. PTY output and client input/resize events use binary frames to avoid base64
overhead. Event-log catch-up is intentionally not part of attach semantics.

### Control messages (request/response)

```json
--> {"type":"create","id":"req-1","terminalId":"pane-xxx","cols":80,"rows":24,"cwd":"/home","argv":["/bin/bash"]}
<-- {"type":"create:ok","id":"req-1","sessionId":"ses-abc","pid":12345}

--> {"type":"attach","id":"req-2","sessionId":"ses-abc"}
<-- {"type":"attach:ok","id":"req-2","streamId":"stream-1","seq":421,"cwd":"/home/project"}

// Input bytes are sent on the binary stream as kind=INPUT frames.

--> {"type":"resize","sessionId":"ses-abc","cols":120,"rows":40}
<-- {"type":"resize:ok"}

--> {"type":"detach","sessionId":"ses-abc"}
<-- {"type":"detach:ok"}

--> {"type":"kill","sessionId":"ses-abc"}
<-- {"type":"kill:ok"}
```

### Binary stream messages

After `attach`, daemon and client exchange binary frames until `detach`:

```txt
frame_header { magic, version, kind, session_id, seq, length, crc32 }
payload[length]

kind=OUTPUT     payload = raw PTY bytes
kind=INPUT      payload = raw user input bytes (client → daemon)
kind=RESIZE     payload = packed cols/rows
kind=SNAPSHOT   payload = live current-screen snapshot envelope bytes
kind=EXIT       payload = packed exit_code/signal
kind=AGENT      payload = compact JSON/msgpack agent status
```

Backpressure:

- Active pane receives live bytes.
- If the client falls behind, taud may drop/coalesce output for that client rather than attempting to
  replay a full historical scrollback.
- Background panes may receive coalesced output only.

---

## Agent Adapters

Agent adapters are **separate scripts** that taud spawns as child processes. The core daemon remains
Zig; adapters are TypeScript/Node (or whatever each agent's ecosystem prefers).

```zig
// adapter.zig — taud spawns adapters as child processes
pub const Adapter = struct {
    provider: []const u8,   // "pi", "codex", "claude", "unknown"

    /// Register a session as agent-driven.
    /// Spawns adapter script with env vars pointing to the session directory.
    pub fn detect(session: *Session, argv: []const []const u8) !?Adapter

    /// Ask the adapter to discover a native session ID.
    pub fn discoverNativeSessionId(adapter: *Adapter) !?[]const u8

    /// Get the resume command line for a known native session.
    pub fn resumeCommand(adapter: *Adapter, native_id: []const u8) ![]const []const u8
};
```

Adapter scripts live at `~/.tau/adapters/<provider>.ts`. Taud communicates with them via
stdin/stdout NDJSON. Adapter execution is a historical design here; provider adapters were
removed from core during the mux pivot. Current repository TypeScript tooling uses Bun.

Example adapter interface:

```typescript
// ~/.tau/adapters/pi.ts
import { readFileSync, writeFileSync } from 'fs'

// Called by taud with JSON on stdin
const msg = JSON.parse(process.argv[2] || '')

switch (msg.command) {
  case 'detect': {
    // Return whether argv matches this agent
    process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify({ detected: true }) + '\n')
    break
  }
  case 'discover-session': {
    // Scan terminal output / env / files for native session id
    const sessionDir = msg.sessionDir
    const match = readFileSync(`${sessionDir}/events.tauev`)
      .toString()
      .match(/pi-session-([a-f0-9]+)/)
    process.stdout.write(
      JSON.stringify({
        nativeSessionId: match?.[1] ?? null,
      }) + '\n',
    )
    break
  }
  case 'resume-command': {
    process.stdout.write(
      JSON.stringify({
        argv: ['pi', '--session', msg.nativeSessionId],
      }) + '\n',
    )
    break
  }
}
```

Cold resume flow:

```
Tau opens previous terminal
  ├─► ask taud for live session
  ├─► if live: attach same PTY
  ├─► else: read agent_sessions row
  ├─► if provider + native_session_id:
  │      spawn adapter.resumeCommand()
  │      attach new PTY
  └─► else: start a fresh shell or saved pane command without replaying old scrollback
```

## taud Build & Launch

### Build

```zig
// apps/daemon/build.zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn build(b: *std.Build) void {
    const exe = b.addExecutable(.{
        .name = "taud",
        .root_source_file = b.path("src/main.zig"),
        .target = b.standardTargetOptions(.{}),
        .optimize = .ReleaseSafe,
    });

    // Link Ghostty's Zig-native libghostty-vt module from build.zig.zon.
    const ghostty = b.dependency("ghostty", .{ .target = target, .optimize = optimize, .simd = false });
    exe.root_module.addImport("ghostty-vt", ghostty.module("ghostty-vt"));

    // Import zig-sqlite from build.zig.zon with FTS5 enabled in b.dependency(...).
    const sqlite = b.dependency("sqlite", .{ .target = target, .optimize = optimize, .fts5 = true });
    exe.root_module.addImport("sqlite", sqlite.module("sqlite"));

    // vt_ghostty_native.zig owns Tau's current-screen snapshot format.

    b.installArtifact(exe);
}
```

### Integrated into desktop build

```json
// apps/desktop/package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:taud": "cd ../taud && zig build",
    "dev": "bun run build:taud && bun run --bun electron-vite dev",
    "build": "bun run build:taud && bun run --bun electron-vite build"
  }
}
```

### Launch from Electron main

```typescript
async function ensureTaudRunning() {
  if (await canConnectToTaud()) return

  const taudPath = join(app.getAppPath(), '..', 'taud', 'zig-out', 'bin', 'taud')
  spawn(taudPath, [], {
    detached: true,
    stdio: 'ignore',
  }).unref()
}
```

---

## UI Layout JSON

`pane-layouts.json` stores workspace/tab/pane layout. Must be read before rendering app shell.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "workspaces": [{ "id": "tau:local", "name": "Local", "projectPath": null, "order": 0 }],
  "activeWorkspaceId": "tau:local",
  "tabs": [
    {
      "id": "tab-xxx",
      "workspaceId": "tau:local",
      "name": "Terminal",
      "layout": "pane-yyy",
      "order": 0
    }
  ],
  "panes": [
    {
      "id": "pane-yyy",
      "terminalId": "term-yyy",
      "tabId": "tab-xxx",
      "type": "terminal",
      "name": "Terminal 1",
      "cwd": null,
      "status": "idle",
      "lastSessionId": "session-abc"
    }
  ],
  "activeTabId": "tab-xxx",
  "activePaneId": "pane-yyy",
  "sidebarExpanded": true,
  "sidebarWidth": 240
}
```

One-time migration from existing `localStorage['tao-workspaces']` or
`localStorage['tau-workspaces']` on first launch.

---

## Session Lifecycle

### Create

```
User creates pane/tab or starts AI agent
  ├─► Renderer → Main → taud: create(terminalId, cols, rows, cwd, argv?)
  ├─► taud: INSERT terminal_sessions (status='live')
  ├─► taud: create session dir, init event log
  ├─► taud: posix_openpt() → fork/exec shell or agent CLI
  └─► Renderer: attach → receive live stream
```

### Detach

```
Pane hidden / window closed / renderer reloads
  ├─► Renderer unsubscribes
  ├─► Main sends detach to taud
  └─► taud keeps PTY + event log running
```

### Kill

```
User explicitly kills session
  ├─► taud sends SIGTERM to PTY child (then SIGKILL after grace)
  ├─► writes EXIT frame to event log
  ├─► updates terminal_sessions status/ended_at
  └─► keeps metadata/log until retention cleanup or clear-history
```

### Optional current-screen snapshot

Compact current-screen snapshots make live reattach first paint nicer when the daemon backend can
serialize the current visible screen. These snapshots must not be used to fake a dead shell/app
restore; if the process is gone, Tau should run a native resume command or start fresh. The renderer
currently applies Ghostty-native VT restore payloads for live first paint and ignores archived/cold
or unsupported formats.

### Reattach

```
Tau UI starts
  ├─► load pane-layouts.json before rendering terminals
  ├─► connect to taud socket
  ├─► for each visible pane: attach(lastSessionId | terminalId)
  ├─► if live: attach to the existing PTY/process
  ├─► if not live but resumable: spawn resume command via adapter
  └─► else: restore layout/cwd and start a fresh shell or saved pane command
```

---

## IPC Surface (Renderer → Electron Main)

Renderer sees session primitives, not raw PTY operations.

```typescript
interface ElectronAPI {
  createSession(input: CreateSessionInput): Promise<CreateSessionResult>
  attachSession(input: AttachSessionInput): Promise<AttachSessionResult>
  detachSession(sessionId: string): Promise<void>
  writeSessionInput(sessionId: string, data: Uint8Array): void
  resizeSession(sessionId: string, cols: number, rows: number): void
  killSession(sessionId: string): Promise<void>
  resumeAgent(agentSessionId: string): Promise<CreateSessionResult>

  onSessionOutput(sessionId: string, callback: (frame: OutputFrame) => void): () => void
  onSessionResize(sessionId: string, callback: (cols: number, rows: number) => void): () => void
  onSessionExit(sessionId: string, callback: (info: ExitInfo) => void): () => void
  onAgentStatus(sessionId: string, callback: (status: AgentStatus) => void): () => void

  readLayout(): Promise<PaneLayoutData | null>
  writeLayout(data: PaneLayoutData): Promise<void>
  readSettings(): Promise<SettingsData | null>
  writeSettings(data: SettingsData): Promise<void>
}
```

---

## Search

Bounded plaintext excerpts can be extracted from logs or future VT state and stored in SQLite FTS5.
Search results are references/debug context, not terminal scrollback restoration.

```sql
SELECT terminal_session_id, title, snippet(terminal_search, 3, '[', ']', '…', 12)
FROM terminal_search
WHERE terminal_search MATCH 'error'
ORDER BY rank
LIMIT 20;
```

---

## Session Cleanup / Retention

Configurable maintenance runs in taud:

- delete exited/killed diagnostic logs older than retention period (default 30 days).
- cap total `~/.tau/sessions` size (default 2 GB).
- keep `status = 'live'` or `'detached'` sessions regardless of age.
- explicit "Clear History" per session / per workspace / all.

---

## Edge Cases

| Scenario                         | Handling                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Renderer crash/reload**        | Reconnect to taud; live PTY never dies.                                                  |
| **Electron app quit**            | Default detach; taud keeps sessions alive.                                               |
| **Daemon crash**                 | Live processes are gone. Use native agent/command resume if available, else start fresh. |
| **Machine reboot**               | No live PTY process. Use agent/command resume if available, else start fresh.            |
| **Snapshot corrupted**           | Ignore the snapshot; do not replay event logs into a fake live terminal.                 |
| **Event log tail huge**          | Retention/clear-history handles disk use; attach does not replay the tail.               |
| **Resize while detached**        | Store latest size metadata and apply it to live/fresh sessions.                          |
| **Multiple panes per workspace** | Sessions keyed by terminal_id/lastSessionId, not workspace.                              |
| **Secrets in terminal output**   | User can disable persistence, reduce retention, clear history, or chmod session files.   |

---

## Dependencies

### Zig (apps/daemon)

- Ghostty Zig package via `build.zig.zon`; `taud` imports its `ghostty-vt` module directly.
- `vrischmann/zig-sqlite` via `build.zig.zon` (replaced earlier hand-rolled `sqlite3.h` C ABI).
- `zstd` via Zig package or system library.
- No Node/npm dependencies in the daemon itself.

### TypeScript (apps/desktop, packages/shared)

- `@effect/sql` (schema validation for desktop-side reads, optional).
- `uuid` (session ID generation in renderer).
- Agent adapter scripts may use Node built-ins only (no heavy deps).

### Maintainers only

```bash
nix develop
zig version  # 0.15.x
zls --version
bun run zig:check
```

| **A**  | **Done**                        | Electron-side bootstrap slice: `pane-layouts.json`, `settings.json`, localStorage migration, stable pane/session IDs, PTY event-log prototype, Electron install repair                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Done      |
| **B**  | **Done**                        | Harden current event-log implementation with tests, corruption handling, retention controls, explicit session IPC wrappers, first-paint/render stability fixes, and current-file-store clear-history controls. Cold scrollback replay/archive restore has since been removed from the app path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Done      |
| **0**  | Done                            | Set up `apps/daemon` Zig project with `build.zig`, Bun workspace scripts, Nix/ZLS/CI tooling, and module skeletons. Tooling is pinned to Zig 0.15.x, `build.zig.zon` now depends on Ghostty, and the daemon uses the Zig-native upstream `ghostty-vt` module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Done      |
| **1**  | **Done**                        | Write core daemon: Unix socket server, JSON control RPC, binary stream, session manager. The socket server, JSON control RPC, in-memory session registry, binary stream frame codec, socket-level attach loop, live PTY streaming, daemon-owned PTY reader threads, and bounded live pending-output buffers are implemented. Electron can now use it through the transitional bridge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Done      |
| **2**  | Done for POSIX prototype        | Write PTY driver. `pty.zig` now uses `forkpty`/`execvp`, resize, input writes, output reads, termination, and exit polling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Done      |
| **3**  | Done for Zig-native VT boundary | `vt.zig` now isolates the VT backend, session objects own upstream Zig-native libghostty-vt state, daemon output/resize paths feed that state, smoke tests cover the wrapper/current-screen boundary, and native snapshots are supported. The fallback and C ABI backends have been retired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Done      |
| **4**  | Done for native live path       | Optional current-screen snapshot extension for nicer live reattach first paint. The daemon has a versioned/CRC-checked `current-screen.state` envelope, Ghostty-native VT snapshot round-trips, detach checkpointing, snapshot DB metadata, event-log snapshot marks, and attach-time snapshot stream frames. Electron now forwards/decodes snapshot frames, applies supported native current-screen snapshots before first paint, suppresses duplicate pending output through the snapshot seq, and ignores archived/cold/unsupported snapshots. Do not use snapshots/event-log tails as cold shell scrollback restore. | Done      |
| **5**  | Done for daemon ownership       | Move framed event log from Electron utility process into `taud`; add append/read/seek/crc tests. The daemon now creates session logs, appends output/resize/exit/snapshot-mark frames, owns retention/clear-history, and the legacy Electron utility logging scaffold has been removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Done      |
| **6**  | **Done**                        | Write SQLite layer (migrations, query functions). `taud` now opens SQLite through `vrischmann/zig-sqlite`, runs migrations, mirrors terminal session lifecycle metadata, records initial agent-session resume rows, indexes bounded search excerpts, and uses restart lookup queries for cold command/agent relaunch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Done      |
| **7**  | Done for production readiness   | Integrate daemon with Electron main (launch, socket client, IPC bridge). A `TaudClient`/MessagePort bridge now launches or connects to `taud`, maps the renderer session protocol to control RPC + binary stream frames, bundles `taud` into desktop production output, health-checks it, restarts after exit/crash, and daemon stream writes drop slow subscribers instead of blocking PTY draining.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Done      |
| **8**  | Done for daemon path            | Renderer attach to live stream and native command/agent resume results. The renderer now uses explicit session APIs, attach results report live/fresh/command-resume/agent-resume, command/agent resume is surfaced in UI, and Electron main no longer falls back to the utility-process PTY service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Done      |
| **9**  | Done for built-in adapters      | Add agent adapter spawning + pi/codex/claude adapter scripts. `taud` now spawns provider scripts from `TAUD_ADAPTER_DIR`/`~/.tau/adapters`, falls back to argv/session-id heuristics, seeds `agent_sessions`, stores resume argv metadata, and desktop builds bundle/pass the adapter directory. Broader third-party adapter hardening remains future work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Done      |
| **10** | **Done for Electron slice**     | Add pane-layouts.json / settings.json services; migrate localStorage. Revisit once `taud` exists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Done      |
| **11** | Done                            | Search excerpts / FTS, daemon cleanup/retention, and daemon-side persistence privacy controls. The daemon-side implementation (indexing, retention, reaping, and settings-driven output/excerpt/snapshot/metadata write gating) is complete. By design, there is no search UI, no session history panel, no clear-history buttons — persistence is invisible. Retention settings auto-clean old sessions; the user sees their terminals, not session metadata.                                                                                                                                                           | Done      |
| **12** | Done                            | Stress/fault-injection hardening for crash/restart supervision, daemon failure boundaries, large stream/log behavior, and agent resume edge cases. Coverage now exercises control-payload oversize rejection, attach-tail preservation, failed/slow subscriber drops without blocking PTY draining, bounded single-frame pending output, bursty stream parsing, oversized stream-header rejection, and fallback to saved command metadata when agent resume metadata is corrupt.                                                                                                                                         | Done      |

**Total**: dominated by adapter hardening, privacy hardening, and VT snapshot hardening. Persistence
is intentionally invisible — no user-facing search, history, or retention UI.

```

- `taud` is a single static Zig binary. No Node, no npm, no WASM runtime for terminal parsing.
- Current-screen snapshots are live reattach polish; Tau does not cold-restore old shell scrollback
  into new processes.
- Agent adapters are lightweight scripts spawned by `taud` — the only part that stays in
  TypeScript/Node.
- The Electron UI is a thin client that attaches/detaches from sessions. The daemon owns the
  persistence and process lifecycle.
